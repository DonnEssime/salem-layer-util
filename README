Usage
=====
(documentation 'salem-layer-util:run 'function)
(salem-layer-util:run KEYS)
Possible KEYS include:
 (:mode              Determines the mode of the program 
                      [DEFAULT-VALUE: :d]
   Possible modes include:
    :d              Decodes file(s) given through ARGS by list of pathnames
                     default output folder: dout
    :e              Encodes file(s) given through ARGS by list of pathnames
                     default output folder: dres
    :da             Decodes a set of files within a specified directory into another
    :ea             Encodes a set of files within a specified directory into another)
   Note: for :da and :ea the two directories needed should be provided through &key args
         first arg within the args list should be source-folder
         second arg within the args list should be result-folder
 (:skip-old t/nil)   Skip processing older files 
                      [DEFAULT-VALUE: t]
 (:verbose t/nil)    Be verbose 
                      [DEFAULT-VALUE: t]
 (:print-skip t/nil) Print skipped files 
                      [DEFAULT-VALUE: nil]
 (:threads n)        Number of threads to execute decoding/encoding of files 
                      [DEFAULT-VALUE: 1]
                      As of right now threads key doesn't change anything.
 (:args '(...))      A list of arguments for the mode given

Sample Usage:
;;Decode two files: res/[1,2].res into dout
(salem-layer-util:run :mode :d
                      :args '("res/1.res" "res/2.res"))
;;Decode all res/cache files from res folder into dec folder
(salem-layer-util:run :mode :da
                      :skip-old nil
                      :args '("res" "dec"))
;;Encode only new res/cache files from dec folder into res folder
(salem-layer-util:run :mode :ea
                      :args '("dec" "res"))


Skipping of older files is based completely off last modified date times
